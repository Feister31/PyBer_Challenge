### OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
  The purpose of the analysis is to understand the relations between the three types of ride types and how or if it is related throughout the seasons. While understanding that the distributions of the final chart is that is a relationship between the frequency of all the trips being taken for January and April.

### Results
  After compiling all the results we can conclude that there is a relationship between all three types while the frequency and the total Fare $(USD) are different but the graph shows that the dates play a great component in changing the results for all three types. The big takeaway from the analysis is that although the three types of trips seem to fall under the same pattern of highs and lows. Only "Suburban" shows a huge increase towards the end of April, which can be contributed to the increased activities of all students finishing school.
